# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Learning to create a webpage for the first time was my motivation while building this Prework Study Guide. I built this Prework Study Guide because I wanted to learn and experience how to make a webpage. In addition, this project helps me keep a central location of notes of new info I've learned from the prework course. Finally, I realized I shouldn't knock myself off doing something I am interested in because it looks brutal.
